Create a CSGMesh or a mesh instance.
  If mesh instance, give it a mesh like cube
  
 add a material, -> spatial
 
 Make material transparent in the transparency section or flags section
 
 in albedo give it a color, blue works best for water. alpha of more than 200 works well
 
 make roughness something like 0.03
 
 download a normal map texture
 
 enable normal map and set the texture to the downloaded texture
 
 set normal map scale to a good scale
 
 you can play with the uv1_offset x or y to see moving water waves.
  self.material.uv1_offset.x += delta * .1
  animation player
